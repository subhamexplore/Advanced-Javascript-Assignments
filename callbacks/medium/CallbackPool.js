// Problem Description – Asynchronous Worker Pool
//
// You are required to create a worker pool that manages the execution
// of asynchronous tasks.
// The pool should ensure that no more than N tasks are running concurrently,
// while any additional tasks are queued.
// As tasks complete, queued tasks should start automatically.
// Each task must invoke its callback with its result when finished.

  constructor(limit) {
    this.limit = limit
    this.active = 0
    this.queue = []

    this._next()
  }

      const {task, onComplete} = this.queue.shift()
      this.active++
      task((err, data)=>{
        onComplete(err, data)
