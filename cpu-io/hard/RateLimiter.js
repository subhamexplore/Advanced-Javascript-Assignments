// Problem Description – Rate Limiter (Token Bucket / Sliding Window)
//
// You are required to implement a `RateLimiter` class that restricts the
// number of executions of a given task within a specific time window.
//
// The limiter should ensure that no more than `limit` tasks are executed
// in any given `windowMs` period.
//
// Requirements:
// 1. The constructor should accept `limit` (max tasks) and `windowMs` (time window).
// 2. The `throttle(task)` method should return a Promise that resolves when the task
//    can be executed.
// 3. If the limit is reached, subsequent tasks must wait until the window allows
//    another execution.
// 4. Tasks should be executed in the order they were submitted (FIFO).
//
// This is a common pattern for API rate limiting and resource management.

class RateLimiter {
  constructor(limit, windowMs) {
    this.limit = limit
    this.windowMs = windowMs
    this.queue = []
    this.timestamps = []
  }

  async throttle(task) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
      this.queue.push({task, resolve, reject})
      this.process()
    })
  }
  process(){
    if(this.queue.length===0) return;
    const now = Date.now()
    this.timestamps = this.timestamps.filter(t => now - t < this.windowMs)
    if(this.timestamps.length<this.limit){
      this.timestamps.push(Date.now())
      const {task, resolve, reject} = this.queue.shift()
      Promise.resolve(task())
      .then(resolve)
      .catch(reject)
      this.process()
    }else{
      const wait = this.windowMs - (now - this.timestamps[0])
      setTimeout(() => {
        this.process()
      }, wait);
    }
  }
