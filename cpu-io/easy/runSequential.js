// Problem Description – Sequential Execution of Async Functions

// You are given an array of asynchronous functions. Your task is to execute them one by one, ensuring that each function starts only after the previous one has completed. 
// The final result should be an array of resolved values in the same order.
async function runSequential(functions) {
    let results=[];
    for(let i=0; i<functions.length; i++)
        results[i] = await functions[i]()
    return results
}
